   - [Twitter Sentiment Analysis:](https://github.com/Sadou14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) A          model to analyse and predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about coronavirus.

   - [Supervised Learning:](https://github.com/Sadou14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Sentiment_analysis.ipynb) Performing Sentiment      Analysis on given tweets about six US airlines, from Twitter using machine learning to      help companies how understand people        are talking about their brand.

   - [Diamond Price:](https://github.com/Sadou14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/diamond_price.ipynb) A model to predict the value of      a given diamond price using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their                  diamond utilizing machine learning.

   - [Supervised machine learning (text classification):](https://github.com/Sadou14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine_Learning%2C_NLP_Text%20Classification.ipynb) The objective of this projet is To build a text classification (or predictive) model. Based on reviews analysis whether it is HR or NON- HR by the used of sentence-level classification. Specifically, it aims to apply sklearn, NLP, classifier,the Naive Bayes algorithm KNN and SVM Support Vector Machines Algorithm. 

  - [Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix factorization:](https://github.com/Sadou14/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Topic_modelling_unsupervised_machine-learning.ipynb) Topic modelling for unsupervised machine learning to analyze fake     news  text data by clustering the documents into groups.
