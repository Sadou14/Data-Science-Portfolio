Supervised machine learning (text classification): The objective of this projet is To build a text classification (or predictive) model, that contains texts (news articles) and labels (either HR[1] or non-HR[0]). Based on reviews analysis whether it is HR or NON-HR by the used of sentence-level classification. Specifically, it aims to apply sklearn, NLP, classifier,the Naive Bayes algorithm KNN and SVM Support Vector Machines Algorithm. 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix factorization topic modelling for unsupervised machine learning to analyze fake news  text data by clustering the documents into groups.
